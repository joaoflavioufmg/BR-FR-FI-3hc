# Designing a Minimum-Cost Health System for Countrywide Universal Coverage

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and supplementary materials for the research paper **"Designing a Minimum-Cost Health System for Countrywide Universal Coverage"**. The project presents a novel analysis framework for designing national health systems that optimize both effectiveness through universal coverage and efficiency through cost minimization.

### Research Context

Our study addresses the critical challenge of healthcare system design by considering multiple factors:
- **Workforce allocation** across different care levels
- **Equipment distribution** for optimal coverage
- **Global cost optimization** while maintaining accessibility
- **Geographical context** and population distribution patterns

The model serves as a medium- and long-term strategic planning tool, leveraging data from prestigious sources including the OECD, World Bank, OpenStreetMap, and national health statistics.

### Case Studies

The framework has been applied and validated across three diverse countries:
- **üáßüá∑ Brazil**: Focus on dispersed populations in central-western regions
- **üá´üá∑ France**: Exploring centralized healthcare model optimization
- **üá´üáÆ Finland**: Addressing northern Finland's unique geographical challenges

## Research Alignment

This work directly supports:
- **UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.8**: Achieving universal health coverage
- **WHO's Human Resources for Health Strategy**: Optimizing healthcare workforce distribution

## Key Findings

### Brazil
- **Investment needed**: $7.95 billion in logistics infrastructure
- **Target**: 1,222 municipalities with low accessibility
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Increase health professional hiring
  - Expand radiotherapy equipment
  - Establish small hospitals and clinics in dispersed areas

### Finland
- **Infrastructure needs**: Additional hospital beds and CT scanners
- **Focus areas**: Northern regions with challenging geography

### France
- **Model recommendation**: More centralized healthcare delivery
- **Investment priorities**: Nursing staff and mammography equipment
- **Strategy**: Municipality-based comprehensive care provision

## Research Methodology

Our approach employs a **location-allocation optimization model** that uniquely integrates:

- **Demographic Data**: Population distribution and healthcare needs
- **Geographic Constraints**: Travel distances and accessibility barriers  
- **Resource Costs**: Workforce salaries, equipment procurement, maintenance
- **Quality Standards**: Meeting clinical guidelines and coverage requirements

The mathematical programming model optimizes the placement and sizing of healthcare facilities while minimizing total system cost subject to universal coverage constraints.
